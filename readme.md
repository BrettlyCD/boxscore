# Boxscore

---

## About this Project

This project is my first full coding project. I really only know the
fundamentals of Python, so it has already been and will be a challenge.
I am an avid lover of sports, so the starting point for this project will be
a simple application that shows the score and boxscore, standings and team
stats for your favorite teams. This is by no means a novel concept, but I
think it will be fun learning opportunity.

## Progression

My goal is to keep building onto this project, using my improvement ideas to
guide me to what to learn next. I want to start with a simple output of data.
From there, possible improvements include adding drill downs into more
historical and player specific stats, create a user interface, implement
user-customization, and even a web and mobile platform.
